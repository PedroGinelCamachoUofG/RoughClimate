# this is the file where the challenge gets solved,
# the functions they code here get imported into the cities when these are instantiated

"""
Use the following functions:
get_connections() -> returns dictionary with the city name and city object
get_communications() -> returns a list with the latest report from each city (each report is a dictionary)
build_defences() -> returns True or False to indicate if action was performed successfully (you can only build once per round)
build_infrastructure() -> returns True or False to indicate if action was performed successfully (you can only build once per round)
send_resources(type, quantity, receiver) -> returns True or False to indicate if action was performed successfully

Some rules, please follow:
Don't use anything else than these functions
Don't edit the other files
If you find a bug, tell me (Pedro)
